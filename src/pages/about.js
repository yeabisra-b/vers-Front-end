        <strong>Electronic Vital Events Registration Program</strong> for the
        Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (FDRE). Our mission is to
        revolutionize the way vital life events are recorded, managed, and
        utilized across Ethiopia by leveraging the power of technology.

        Our Purpose
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4 text-black">
        The registration of vital events, including births, deaths, marriages,
        divorces, and adoptions, is essential for personal identity, governance,
        and public planning. Historically, manual paper-based systems have led
        to inefficiencies, data loss, and delays. Our program addresses these
        challenges with a centralized, automated solution focused on accuracy,
        security, and ease of use.
      </p>
